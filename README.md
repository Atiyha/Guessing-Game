# Guessing-Game
This is my guessing game which allows user to enter any number and matches it with the one generated
1. You first need to run the project so you can run the game
2. the game will ask you to input a number between 1 and 100
3. it will then generate a random number internally
4. it will then try to match your input value with the one generated internally
5. if it does not match and your value is lower than the random number generated, it will display, "Too low! Try again."
6. if it does not match and your value is higher than the random number generated, it will display, "Too high! Try again."
7. If it matches your value, it will display, "Congratulations! The value is (shows the value) and shows the number of tries.
